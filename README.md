# cryptopals
My solution to the Matasano Cryptopals challenges.
These challenges ask you to build and break crypto systems with attacks that apply to real world implementations.

Solved up to and including the [Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Simple)](https://cryptopals.com/sets/2/challenges/12) challenge.
