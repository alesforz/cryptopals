# cryptopals
My solutions to the [Matasano Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) challenges.
These challenges ask you to build and break crypto systems with attacks that apply to real world implementations.

I'm currently (slowly) going through them.
So far, solved up to and including the [Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Harder)](https://cryptopals.com/sets/2/challenges/14) challenge (Challenge 14 of set 2).

Note: I focus on solving the challenges rather than on having pristine code ;)
