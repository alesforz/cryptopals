# cryptopals
My solutions to the [Matasano Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) challenges.
These challenges ask you to build and break crypto systems with attacks that apply to real world implementations.

I'm currently (slowly) going through them.
So far, I solved the first two sets.

Note: I focus on solving the challenges rather than on having pristine code ;)
