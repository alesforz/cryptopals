# cryptopals
My solutions to the [Matasano Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) challenges.
These challenges ask you to build and break crypto systems with attacks that apply to real world implementations.

I'm currently (slowly) going through them.

Last problem solved: [Implement CTR, the stream cipher mode](https://cryptopals.com/sets/3/challenges/18)
(Challenge 18 of Set 3).

Note: I focus on solving the challenges rather than on having pristine code ;)
